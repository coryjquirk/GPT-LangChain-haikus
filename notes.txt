--------------------------------

Write me a haiku about:
water bottles

Haiku: Crisp trans·lu·cent Bot·tle in my hand so cold Hap·pi·ly quench·ing

Haiku syllable count: 10 syllables

Is the AI's haiku a haiku? thirst

No, this poem does not fit the definition of a haiku. The standard format of a haiku is three lines of 5, 7, and 5 syllables respectively.
